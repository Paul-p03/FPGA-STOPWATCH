This is a Real-Time stopwatch project I created using an FPGA board and Verilog implementation. This timer counts from 0-59.99 seconds, accounting for hundredths of a second, while automatically resetting to 0 once reaching the maximum limit. This was my final project for the Digital Logic Design course. I incorporated a start and stop feature alongside a reset button for user interaction.
